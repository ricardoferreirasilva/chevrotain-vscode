# Chevrotain for Visual Studio Code

This project is a [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) extension for development with [Chevrotain](https://github.com/SAP/chevrotain). I decided to develop it to improve my own Chevrotain development experience and make it open-source in case any others decide to take advantage of this wonderful tool with Visual Studio Code. 

## Features

At the moment the only feature that is buing developed is code snippets. Others may be added in the future. The primary target of this extension is for Typescript, however, I might add support for Javascript aswell in the future.

## Requirements

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)
